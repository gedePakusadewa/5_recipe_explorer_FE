### Project Description:

Create a Recipe Explorer application that allows users to explore, search, and save their favorite recipes. The application will use a third-party recipe API to fetch recipe data and display it to users. Users can create accounts, log in, and save their favorite recipes for easy access.

Key Features:

- User Authentication

  Allow users to create accounts and log in. Implement secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data.

- Recipe Search

  Integrate a recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular, Edamam) to fetch a wide variety of recipes. Implement a search functionality to allow users to find recipes based on ingredients, cuisine, or dietary preferences.

- Recipe Details

  Display detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information. ~Allow users to rate and leave comments on recipes~ (NOT IMPLEMENTED).

- Save and Favorite

  Enable users to save their favorite recipes to their profile. Implement a "favorites" section where users can quickly access their saved recipes.

- User Profile

  Create user profiles where users can view and manage their saved recipes, personal information, and preferences. ~Display a history of recently viewed recipes~(NOT IMPLEMENTED).

- ~Responsive Design~ (NOT-IMPLEMENTED)

  Ensure the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

- Backend API

  Develop a backend API to handle user authentication, recipe data storage, and user-specific data. Create endpoints for user registration, login, fetching recipes, saving favorites, etc.

- Data Persistence:

  Implement a database to store user information, saved recipes, and other relevant data. Use appropriate database technologies like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.

- ~Security~ (NOT-IMPLEMENTED)
  
  Implement security best practices to protect user data, including encryption for sensitive information.

- ~Notifications~ (NOT-IMPLEMENTED)

  Implement email notifications for account verification, password reset, and other relevant events.
